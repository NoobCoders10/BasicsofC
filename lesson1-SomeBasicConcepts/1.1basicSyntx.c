#include<stdio.h>
// 'include' is the keyword used to call the default modules to our code

/*
 it is the main function we are written in c language. the word 'int' defines the the data type of our function ie Integer . we can write two type of main function in c
	1. int main function(above example)-if we define a int function we wanted to write return keyword . (it is mandatory).
	2. also we can decleare a void function in c . such as 
		#include <stdio.h>

		void main(){
		}
	here it is not mandatory to write return keyword in void function

	it is mandatory to write main function in every c programme.
