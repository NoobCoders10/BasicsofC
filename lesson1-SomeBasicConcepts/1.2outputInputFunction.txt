As I told you that the usage of any programming langauage is for communicating with user and to the system.
As a Programmer we can interact with Users as Giving an output and get an Input . 

For giving an Output we use we can use the function called 'printf'.

the syntx of printf is : printf("what we want to print write here"); 

you can understand how printf work in the next c file you can also execute that file . (helloWorldProgramme.c)

For get an Input form the user we can use the function called 'scanf'.

the syntx of scanf is  : scanf("(formator)",&name of the varible);

you can understand how scanf work in the inputFuction.c file . you can also execute that programme.

for get an idea about formators visit formator.txt file included in this lesson.
