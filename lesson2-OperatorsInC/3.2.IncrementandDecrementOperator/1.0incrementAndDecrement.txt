C programming has two operators increment ++ and decrement -- to change the value of an operand (constant or variable) by 1.

Increment ++ increases the value by 1 whereas decrement -- decreases the value by 1. These two operators are unary operators, 
meaning they only operate on a single operand.

we have two type of Increment and Decrement function . 

    1.prefix or pre
    2.postfix or post

In programming (Java, C, C++, JavaScript etc.), the increment operator ++ increases the value of a variable by 1. 
Similarly, the decrement operator -- decreases the value of a variable by 1.

ie; for example 
    a = 5
    ++a;          // a becomes 6
    a++;          // a becomes 7
    --a;          // a becomes 6
    a--;          // a becomes 5

++ and -- operator as prefix and postfix
If you use the ++ operator as a prefix like: ++var, the value of var is incremented by 1; 
then it returns the value.
If you use the ++ operator as a postfix like: var++, the original value of var is returned first; 
then var is incremented by 1.

The -- operator works in a similar way to the ++ operator except -- decreases the value by 1.

let us see one one examples on comming c files.
