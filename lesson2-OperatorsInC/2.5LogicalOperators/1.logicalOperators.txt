An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether expression results true or false. Logical operators are commonly used in decision making in C programming.

Operator	  Meaning	                                                  Example
  &&	      Logical AND. True only if all operands are true	          If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) && (d>5)) equals to 0.
  ||	      Logical OR. True only if either one operand is true	      If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) || (d>5)) equals to 1.
  !	        Logical NOT. True only if the operand is 0	              If c = 5 then, expression !(c==5) equals to 0.


  for better understanding Please read the c file and write your own code.
  we want to use these in comming lessons. you can under it there very well.
