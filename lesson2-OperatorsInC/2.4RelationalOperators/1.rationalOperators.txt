A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.

Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.

we are going to discuss about the decision making and loops on comming lessons.

Operator	Meaning of Operator	        Example
  ==       	Equal to	                5 == 3 is evaluated to 0
  >	        Greater than	            5 > 3 is evaluated to 1
  <	        Less than	                5 < 3 is evaluated to 0
  !=	    Not equal to	            5 != 3 is evaluated to 1
  >=	    Greater than or equal to	5 >= 3 is evaluated to 1
  <=	    Less than or equal to	    5 <= 3 is evaluated to 0

for true conditions programming language returns 1 and for false it is 0.

we want to use these in comming lessons. you can under it there very well.
