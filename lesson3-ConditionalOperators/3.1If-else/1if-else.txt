The most important conditional checking statement is if-else. We use conditional statements for checking the conditions , and processed with
the code.

at first we want to understand the syntx of conditional statements . In this chapter we are going to the first conditional statement ie,
if-else.


syntx of if else:

if(condition want to check){
    code want to excecute if the condition is true;
}else{
    code want to excecute if the condition is false;
}

simple syntx right?

Working of if-else:

I am going to explain if-else with an example, I want to write a programme that user enter a value and show the value even or odd .

here we need the conditional statement , now we are if-else so we are going to use that. Here we want to check whether the enterd number is even
or odd , if it is even print even number or if it is odd print odd number.

how to find a even or odd? 

for that we completed lesson 2 the operators in c , there is special operators called modulus (%) do you remember this operator?

if we take modulus of the entered number with 2 if it gives zero as reminder than it is a even number else it is odd number

Now we get the logic of our problem , but how to write in the code?

we can write it like this

if(num % 2 == 0){
    printf("Even Number");
}else{
    printf("Odd Number");
}


how is it works? 
at first it takes the number and take modulus with respect to 2 if it give 0 then code inside the if block will be excecuted. if it gives other than 0 
then code inside the else block will be excecute. 

For better understanding provided code of this problem  , understand these codes and write your self in your favorite ide or code editor

all the best....
