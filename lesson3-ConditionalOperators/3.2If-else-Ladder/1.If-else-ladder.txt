if-else working is also similar of if-else. But here we want to check more than one condition. 
For understanding the working of if-else ladder , we can take the problem as we taken in the if-else lesson

But there is a small change in the problem statement 
while we checking the number is even or odd we want to also check the number is zero or not ? 
(DIY: what is the output , If I enter zero in the previous solution)

As our previous knowledge we can write a solution as :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int num;

    if(num ==0){
        printf("The number is Zero");
    }else{
        if(num % 2 == 0){
            printf("Even Number");
        }else{
            printf("Odd Number");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}


Here we are using two distingnt if else or if-else in a if-else that's called nested if-else. But you think if I want to check one
more condition like is the enterd number is negative or not , while using nested if-else the program look like a complex one, Here 
we can use the if-else ladder.Like this:

if(num < 0){
    printf("Number is negative");
}else if(num == 0){
    printf("Number is zero");
}else if(num %2 ==0){
    printf("Number is even");
}else {
    printf("number is odd");
}

Program looks simple right? the next question is how it work?

At first (the first if) checks the enterd number is less than zero or not . If the number is less than zero (negative) then it print 
the Number is zero else , In the else part we again write a if condition right? it checks the number is zero or not if number is zero
it print the number is zero. again in the else part we write a if condition for checking the number is even or not. if it is even its 
print the number is even other wise it goes to the last else part, When the number comes to this else part that means the number not
statisfing non of the above conditions, right? so it print the number is odd.


We can right else if as we want .


I think this enough for explain the if else ladder? any more doubts please ask in the discussion section. And also do this Program
by yourself and I am also attached c file of this program . Please understand the logic behind this. 

In the Problem soving folder of this lesson I added more question for if-else and if-else ladder . also it's solutions
so goto there and try to solve that questions by yourself

Thank You..................
