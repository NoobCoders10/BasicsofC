if-else working is also similar of if-else. But here we want to check more than one condition. 
For understanding the working of if-else ladder , we can take the problem as we taken in the if-else lesson

But there is a small change in the problem statement 
while we checking the number is even or odd we want to also check the number is zero or not ? 
(DIY: what is the output , If I enter zero in the previous solution)

As our previous knowledge we can write a solution as :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int num;

    if(num ==0){
        printf("The number is Zero");
    }else{
        if(num % 2 == 0){
            printf("Even Number");
        }else{
            printf("Odd Number");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
