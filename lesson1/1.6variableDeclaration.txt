Variable Delcaration:

	for declearing a variable in C , first you want to mention the data type of the variable and the name of the variable . Such as ;
			int a ;

Here I declare a variable called a, At first I mentioned the datatype of that variable such as 'int' and the varable name a. ';' is for completing the syntx. If you declare a varible like this the computer  will  assign a empty space in the memory. 

also we can declare a varible with a value. As,
			int a = 5;
it allocate a space in the memory for storing a integer varible called a with value 5.

As we write in the case declaration of c we can also declare variable in float , char and double . As,

	float b=5.67;
	char c='h';
	double d = 56.77;

*The important thing if we declare a variable use the name for what purpose we are using that varible.
for example , if we declare a varible for storing a input number we can name that variable as , 
	num or num1 or inp or inp1 or inpnum.

It wil help other can understand the code very easily.
