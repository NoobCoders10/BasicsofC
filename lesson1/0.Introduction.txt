So friends this is the first lesson . here we want to cover the basic syntx of c programming , input-output function in c , datatypes , formators and variable

1. comment one line . you can use two slah sign ('//').
Eg. : //this is a comment.

2. comment multiple line . you can use '/**/' and the comment should write between two * sign.
