in c there are primitive datatypes and other datatypes

primitive datatypes are :
	1. int 
		it refers to the integer value.such as 0,1,2,3 etc 
	2.float
		it refers to the decimal value.such as 90.3,5.44 etc. A float can print 6 digits after the decimal.
	3. char
		it refers to the character. such as our english alphabets.
	4. boolen
		it can only print true or false.

other datatypes are:
	1. String
		it is the group of char values. for example our name is group of character right? it is called a string.

	2. Double
		double is nothing but a float value but double are of two types.
		 
		1)short double : it can print last 8  digits after decimal point 
		2)long double : it can print last 16 digits after decimal point

		double is 2 times more accurate than a float .



Data conversion:

the smallest unit of data is bits it is represented by 'b'

8 bits = 1 Bytes (Bytes represented by 'B')
1024 Bytes =  1 KiloBytes(KB)
1024 KB =  1 MegaBytes(MB)
1024 MB =  1 GigaBytes(GB)
1024 GB =  1 TetraBytes(TB)
1024 TB =  1 PetaBytes(PB)




Occurence of Datatypes memory:

If we want to store a integer in (datetype int) our memory it will take 4 Bytes in memory ie 32bits.

similarly:

A float value take 4 Bytes also
A char value take 1 Bytes
A short double take 8 Bytes
A long double take 16 Bytes in our memory .


For now you want to only understand these things . The concept of these you were understand later
