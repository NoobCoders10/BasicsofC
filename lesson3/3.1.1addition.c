//TODO: write a programme which print sum of two Integer numbers. Input must be take from the user.

// include the standard functions
#include<stdio.h>

//write our main function .
int main(){
    //at the first line of main programme , in c we want to declare all the variables use in the programme.
    // we want totally 3  varible . ie , num1 , num2 (storing the user inputs)and sum (storing the addition value)
    // in problem they mention that datatype of these elements are integer.so let us declare.
    int num1, num2 , sum; 
    /* you can also do like this ;
    int num1;
    int num2;
    int sum;
    but they are all of same datatype right? we can also write like above

    */

   /* then we want to take inputs form user . so we want to use the scanf function here.
   */


    return 0;//integer function must return something . here it is our main function did'nt wanted return anything so return zero.
    //you can understand what is th use of return when we reach lesson
