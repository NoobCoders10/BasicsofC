Like mathematics in programming also we have arthematic operator . 

for Addition we use '+' operator. 
for Substraction we use '-' operator. 
for multiplication we use '*' operator .
for Division we use '/' operator .

for the examples of arthematic operators read , execute the c files comming after this file . 

ie:, 3.1.1 addition.c
3.1.2 substraction.c
3.1.3 multiplication.c 
3.1.4 division.c

these c files can execute and it will print the correct values. In above mentioned file done as take input from the user. Please 
make sure that from these lesson keep practising with us.

if any case of doubt the time of coding yourself Please come and read the files once more.

I hope these repos make you c programming easier .
